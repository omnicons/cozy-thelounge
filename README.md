# The Lounge for Cozy Cloud

This is a port of the [The Lounge](https://thelounge.github.io/) irc client for [Cozy Cloud](https://cozy.io/).

Most of the code is actually in [this other repo](https://github.com/y-lohse/lounge). This one only does a couple of things:

- create a configuration file when the app is installed
- make the html/css/js files for the client servable
- switch The Lounge to private mode and create a user
- start the lounge without using the command line
